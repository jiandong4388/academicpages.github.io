**Abstract**

We propose nonparametric estimators for the explicative part of the noise in a model where the
market microstructure noise is an unknown function of the trading information while allowing
for the presence of an additional residual noise component. Our method allows for dependence
in the observable trading information and accommodates the presence of infinite variation
jumps in the efficient price process. We establish the convergence and asymptotic normality
of the proposed estimators. We also propose a two-step Laplace estimator of integrated
volatility where we replace the observed price with the estimated price by removing the
explicative part of the market microstructure noise. The finite sample properties of both the
nonparametric estimators and the two-step Laplace estimator are examined through Monte Carlo
simulations. We find that our method is robust to misspecification of the unknown functional
form given finite sample size. Furthermore, an empirical application using high-frequency data
demonstrates that our method outperforms commonly employed parametric methods.
